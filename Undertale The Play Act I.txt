ACT I
Ruins


Scene 1
FRISK alone

(FRISK isn't originally present. He falls from a hole and lands on the bed of golden flowers on the bottom. He looks woody and slowly gets up.)

FRISK.
Where am I? What is this place? Why did I fall?

(While speaking, FRISK slowly reaches the place where FLOWEY stands.)


Scene 2
FRISK, FLOWEY

FLOWEY.
Howdy! I am Flowey! Flowey the flower!

FRISK.
Who asked?

FLOWEY.
I'm your new best friend!

FRISK.
NO YOU'RE NOT.

FLOWEY.
You just fell? Guess ol' Flowey's got to teach ya the basics of this world!

FRISK.
GET AWAY FROM ME!

FLOWEY.
You see, here, LV is spread through... little white friendliness pellets.

FRISK.
What's LV, anyway?

FLOWEY.
LV? Why, LOVE of course! Don't you want LOVE?

FRISK.
Probably not from you!

FLOWEY.
Go on, catch them, why don't cha? Catch all that you can!

FRISK.
No I won't!

(FLOWEY throws white friendliness pellets to FRISK that dodges them.)

FLOWEY. (slightly annoyed)
Hey kiddo, you misunderstood me. You must run into them!

(FLOWEY continues, FRISK still dodges the pellets.)

FLOWEY. (frankly annoyed)
Are you dumbhead? RUN. INTO. THE. BULLETS. *PELLETS.

FRISK.
NO I WON'T!

FLOWEY.
In this world, it's KILL or BE killed!

(TORIEL then arrives and throws fireballs at FLOWEY who dissapears.)


Scene 3
TORIEL, FRISK

TORIEL.
What a horrible creature, torturing such a poor, innocent youth...

FRISK.
If you say so?

TORIEL.
Fear not, my child. I am Toriel, the caretakers of the Ruins, and I'll guide you through the catacombs.

FRISK.
WHY YOU ALL TELL ME TO DO THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME?

TORIEL.
Oi! You must be british, ain't ya? Can't understand you, my child, speak clearly!

FRISK.
Anyway, anyway...

(The set changes to a puzzle in the Ruins. It consists of three lamps with levers. The first one is labelled with a cross, the second one with a tick. The thrid one isn't labelled. On the other side of the room stands a dummy. The two parts of the room are separed by a thick wall.)

TORIEL.
I think you can solve the puzzle alone, I've labelled the levers.

(FRISK flips the lever labelled with a cross. Nothing happens.)

TORIEL.
ARE YOU DUMB, MY CHILD? DO NOT YOU KNOW WHAT A CROSS DOES MEAN, YOU STUPID CHILD? CROSS MEANS NO, STOP, DON'T PASS, DO NOT FLIP, MY CHILD. USE YOUR BRAIN IF YOU HAVE ONE, YOU STUPID MORON, MY CHILD.

(FRISK flips the lever labelled with a tick. Nothing happens either.)

TORIEL.
Oh. I must've labelled wrong. Try pulling the third lever, my child.

FRISK.
Are you bipolar?

(TORIEL doesn't seem to have heard it. FRISK eventually pulls the third lever and the thick wall separing the two rooms suddenly vanishes.)

TORIEL.
This is a dummy, my child, just like you are. Try talking to it.

(FRISK violently anihilates the dummy out of existence.)

TORIEL.
ARE YOU STUPID, MY CHILD? I TOLD YOU TO TALK TO IT, NOW TO PUNCH IT SO THAT YOU DESTROY IT. OH I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, I'LL GO HOME, MY CHILD. GOOD LUCK GOING ON ALONE.

(TORIEL leaves. FRISK follows her. The set changes to a great empty corridor.)


Scene 4
FRISK alone

(FRISK walks through the corridor and talks.)

FRISK.
God, I must be high. Very high. First I fall in a hole, I meet a talking flower, that wants to kill me, then a goat fireballs the flower... and she takes me with her, I have to solve puzzles... what's the next step? A talking ghost?...

(The set changes to NAPSTABLOOK's place.)

FRISK.
...AND A TALKING GHOST!

NAPSTABLOOK.

NAPSTABLOOK.

FRISK.

NAPSTABLOOK.

FRISK.
You seem pretty normal. Tell me, why are you here?

NAPSTABLOOK.

FRISK.
Never mind, you're as crazy as the others. Anyway, could you let me through?

NAPSTABLOOK.

(NAPSTABLOOK vanishes. FRISK passes through.)

(FRISK flips the first, third and fifth levers. Nothing happens.)

PUZZLE.

(FRISK decides to flip every lever randomly.)

PUZZLE.

FRISK.

(FRISK eventually flips every lever on, the puzzle opens the door.)

PUZZLE.
Fuyioh! Uncle Roger proud of you, nephew! Keep this up! Maybe one day you'll be able to make egg fried rice!

(FRISK reaches TORIEL's house. The set changes once again.)

TORIEL.
Oh, you found your way home, my child. I baked you pie!

FRISK.
Butterscotch pie?

TORIEL.
No, snail pie you failure of a child, you'd never deserve something better.

FRISK.
But it's no good!

TORIEL.
WELL THEN DON'T EAT! GO SLEEPING, MY CHILD, YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED!

(TORIEL opens FRISK's bedroom. It's full of beds and villagers.)

TORIEL.
GOOD NIGHT!

(FRISK goes in the bedroom and "sleeps" for a while. After some time, he wakes up and goes to TORIEL.)

TORIEL.
Oh, you're already up, my child?

FRISK.
You're really bipolar, aren't you?

TORIEL.
Anyway, what do you want, my child?

FRISK.
How to get back home?

TORIEL.
What? You want to hear about the book I'm reading? It's called "75 Uses of Sl- *Snails"

FRISK.
HOW TO GET OUT?

TORIEL.
Did you know that snails are very slow?

FRISK.
NO SHIT, HOW TO GET OUT?

TORIEL.
Did you know that your dad is in the mirror ?

(FRISK runs to the mirror and sees his father. He comes back to TORIEL.)

FRISK.
Fine, but HOW CAN I EXIT THOSE FREAKING RUINS?

TORIEL.
Wait there, my child, I've got places to go.

(TORIEL leaves, as FRISK follows her. The set changes to the last corridor of the Ruins.)

TORIEL.
You shouldn't exit my child...

FRISK.
Why?

TORIEL.
If you do, they... ASGORE will...

FRISK.
Who da hail is Asgore?

TORIEL.
You should not know, my child. Now be good and go in your bedroom.

FRISK.
What are you doing?

TORIEL.
I'll destroy this tunnel, forever. Six humans have passed by, none of them has returned!

FRISK.
ARE YOU CRAZY? LET ME THROUGH!

TORIEL.
DO YOU WANT TO DIE? IS DEATH YOUR WILL? IF IT IS, JUST KICK YOUR OWN STOOL!

FRISK.
Let. me. through.

TORIEL.
Then, you'll have to pass through me!

(TORIEL and FRISK fight. FRISK pushes TORIEL and is in front of the door.)

TORIEL.
Very well, then, my child. I'll let you through. Never come back, you're not welcome.

FRISK.
Fine. Thanks anyway, Toriel.

(TORIEL leaves, as FRISK passes through the doorway. The curtain falls.)
